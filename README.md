# 25 React Projcts

**My path from novice to experienced React programmer.**

When I began the Data Visualization Curriculum at Free Code Camp I quickly realized that React was way above my head. To improve my understanding of React, I began this project where I would create 25 simple applications using React, each ideally utilizing different features of the library. The code for each of these projects is provided here, and below I list several resources/tutorials that I found very helpful throughout the process of learning React. These resources are intended to provide a general path that can bring a beginner up to speed with the powerful React library.

*You can see all of these projects live here.*

**Useful Guides, Tutorials, and other Resources all available for free online. They are organized generally in order from beginner to advanced.**
* [Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html) - The definitive starting place. All of the Facebook documentation is excellent and a great go-to resource moving forward.
* [Thinking in React Screencast Tutorial](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mFEoarLnnqM) - A very nice and short Youtube tutorial by Hendrik Swanepoel of Tagtree demonstrating many of the 'Thinking in React' principles.
* [React for Everyone](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLLnpHn493BHFfs3Uj5tvx17mXk4B4ws4p) - LevelUpTuts Video Tutorial Series introducing you to React. This is a great place to start with the basics.
* [Basic React Tutorial Series](https://egghead.io/courses/react-fundamentals) - Awesome free video series by Joe Maddalone on Egghead.io walking you through a number of basic React demonstrations. You begin working with webpack and babel in the series, which I recommend, but you can also quickly start writing React in Codepen.
* [9 things every React.js beginner should know](https://camjackson.net/post/9-things-every-reactjs-beginner-should-know) - Some React best practices by full stack developer Cam Jackson.
* [Navigating the React.JS Ecosystem](https://www.toptal.com/react/navigating-the-react-ecosystem) - A great article by Tomas Holas outlining the main tools and libaries used by React developers.
* [Presentational and Container Components](https://medium.com/@dan_abramov/smart-and-dumb-components-7ca2f9a7c7d0#.rit45x4yv) - A Medium article by Dan Abramov on defining components in React.
* [ReactJS Program](http://www.reactjsprogram.com/) - Tyler McGinnis has created these excellent React tutorials, the first of which is free. I cannot recommend these resources enough.
