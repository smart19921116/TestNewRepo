# 25 React Projcts

**My path from novice to experienced React programmer.**

When I began the Data Visualization Curriculum at Free Code Camp I quickly realized that React was way above my head. To improve my understanding of React, I began this project where I would create 25 simple applications using React, each ideally utilizing different features of the library. The code for each of these projects is provided here, and below I list several resources/tutorials that I found very helpful throughout the process of learning React.

*You can see all of these projects live here.*

**Useful Guides/Blog Posts, organized in order from beginner to advanced topics:**
* [Thinking in React](https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html) - The definitive starting place; all of the Facebook React documentation is excellent.



**Useful Tutorials, organized generally from beginner to advanced:**
* [ReactJS Program](http://www.reactjsprogram.com/) - Tyler McGinnis has created these excellent React tutorials, the first of which is free. I cannot recommend these resources enough.
