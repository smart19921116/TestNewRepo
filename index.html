				<h1 class = "contentTitle">What is React?</h1>
				<p class = "contentText">React is a powerful and influential Javascript library developed by Facebook and open sourced a few years ago. It has since gained in popularity throughout the Javascript world, despite some initial skepticism. It describes itself as the 'V' in the MVC model, uses a virtual DOM to render HTML updates in a very efficient manner, and allows you to write HTML within your Javascript code (really!).</p>

				<p class="contentText">Today React comes with a wide range of tools and additional libraries that allow entire applications to be build with React, and there are even projects like React Native that port React to native mobile systems. React works by breaking everything down into components and places strict but clear rules on how data can flow between, and change, these components. This makes designing an application conceptually simple and also breaks the code into discrete, composable pieces that are very easy to work with.</p>

			<div class = "contentWrapper">
				<h1 class = "contentTitle">Learning the React Ecosystem</h1>
				<p class = "contentText">After finishing the Front End Certification at Free Code Camp, I proceeded confidently into the Data Visualization Projects... only to be quickly shut down. Components, ES6, render functions, state? The instructional content for these Free Code Camp challenges was not been completed yet at this time, and it became clear to me that Google searching my way each error message wasn't going to work very well. I didn't even know what a React component was! I needed a strong foundation in React before I could continue.</p>

				<p class = "contentText">I decided to start from scratch and build 25 projects using React. I would only proceed to the Free Code Camp challenges when I had a very clear idea of how I would build them. As my knowledge of React grew, I decided to go back and re-build all of the major Front End Projects. This was actually a very interesting experience because it allowed me to see a comparison of how I could build these projects without, and then with, React. I summarized that experience and analyzed the two attempts <a href = "https://github.com/bonham000/React-Front-End-Projects">here</a>.</p>

				<p class = "contentText">At this point I had finished about 20 projects using React, and I felt ready to return to the React Challenges in Free Code Camp. I did so, and successfully completed them, working much more efficiently than I otherwise would have been capable of. I think this is largely due to slowing building up my skills from the very basics to more advanced topics before even attempting these challenges.</p>

				<p class = "contentText">I was only able to accomplish all of this because there are some smart developers out there who have taken the time to create really excellent quality educational content. To help any future newcomers to the React world, I've compiled below a list of the best resources I came across while learning React (as of June 2016!). Now, everyone has a unique learning style and will be at a different place in their knowledge as a developer when trying to learn something new like React. Maybe you've been building Angular apps for years, or maybe you don't even know what an MVC is (like me!). These resources worked really well for me, but each person may find different resources to be better, and new material will certainly be created in the future (I'm writing this in July 2016). However, I can vouch for the quality of all of the following. These are organized roughly in order of beginning to advanced level material, and illustrate what I think to be a good learning pathway for React JS and everything that comes with it.</p>
