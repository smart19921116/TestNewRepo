				<p class = "contentText">React is a powerful and influential Javascript library. While working through the Free Code Camp Full Stack Javascript curriculum, I decided to build these 25 projects using React. Nearly half are actually projects from the FCC curriculum, in fact I re-built all 8 of the major Front End Projects (see that project's <a href = "https://github.com/bonham000/React-Front-End-Projects">Github here</a> for an interesting comparison of my 1st and 2nd attempts).</p>

				<p class = "contentText">While building these projects, I enountered many resources in the process of learning React and the React ecosystem. Here I've compiled a list of the most useful resources I came across in order to to help anyone else who might be aspiring to learn more about React. There are many excellent resources available online, so I encourage you to find what suits your learning style. However, I can recommend the following (organized roughly in order of beginning to advanced level).</p>

				<a class = "title" href = "https://facebook.github.io/react/docs/thinking-in-react.html"><h1>Thinking in React</h1></a>
